我們這種渺小的生物，居住在一顆塵埃上，如何想出怎麼發射太空船，進入銀河系的繁星中？
那是世世代代追尋者的心血，他們謹記五條簡單的原則：

### 1. 質疑權威
即使某人說是如此，也不表示真是如此，包括我。

### 2. 獨立思考

### 3. 質疑自己
別只因為你想相信而去相信，相信某件事，並不表示那是事實。用觀察與實驗獲得的證據來測試。若你喜歡的想法禁不起設計良好的測試，它就是錯的，放下它吧。

### 4. 追隨證據，無論它通往哪裡
如果你沒有證據，就別妄自評論。

### 5. 你可能是錯的
即使最頂尖的科學家，也會搞錯某些事情。牛頓，愛因斯坦，以及歷史上每一個偉大科學家，都會犯錯，他們當然會犯錯，他們只是凡人。

How did we, tiny creatures living on that speck of dust, ever manage to figure out how to send spacecreaft out among the stars of the Milky Way?

It was the work of generations of searchers who took five simple rules to heart.

### 1. Question authority
No idea is true just because someone says so, including me.

### 2. Think for your self

### 3. Question your self
Don't believe anything just because you want to. Believing something doesn't make it so. Test ideas by the evidence gained from observation and experiment. If a favorite idea fails a well-designed test, it's wrong. Get over it.

### 4. Follow the evidence, wherever it leads
If you have no evidence, reserve judgment.

### 5. You could be wrong
Even the best scientists have been wrong about some things. Newton, Einstein, and every other great scientist in history, they all made mistakes. Of course they did. They are human.
